INTRODUCTION
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died in the sinking, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

While sheer luck played a partial role in whether or not a person made it onto a lifeboat, it was also told that the more wealthy passengers were favored and allowed off the ship first, leaving other passengers with much less possbility of surviving. The data greatly supports this story.

DESIGN
I felt the stacked bar was an obvious choice working with the given data set. I wanted to highlight how many died vs. how many survived by the ballpark amount paid for a ticket. A stacked bar puts the two counts directly against each other and allows me to sort by fare range. Other visualizations such as a pie chart or scatterplot may have been contorted into serving a similar purpose but the stacked bar makes it simple to compare the two counts by size.


FEEDBACK
Feedback 1
The first person to review the visualizations indicated they felt the data should be split into more bins (there were originally only 3). Given the disparity of the fare prices it was difficult to find an adequate delimiter for the bins, however after splitting the bins into 4 you clearly see the disparity, especially at the higher fare end. After breaking the bins into 4 this user had no additional feedback and found the information straightforward.

Feedback 2
The second reviewer was mostly clear on the information beign conveyed by the chart (this was after the revisions made from feedback 1). One wish they made was to see the actual headcount in each bar in the stacked bar chart. I found this feature was not offered natively in dimple however the developer did offer a workaround for how to offer the counts. After adding the counts into the bar chart this reviewer was very pleased.

Feedback 3
The third reviewer didn't have much else to add. The data was pretty clear at this point (after revisions made for feedback 1 and 2). There was some suggenstion that the disparity still wasn't entirely crystal clear, which sparked me to create the table alongside the stacked bar chart. This shows a plain percent count that shows how many passengers survived based on the same bins as the stacked bar. This resolved this reviewers indications regarding clarity.
